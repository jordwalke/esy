# This Repo Is Only Here To Track Issues for [`esy`](https://github.com/reasonml/esy)

# Helping Out

### Project Needs
- Check for issues marked `HIGH PRI` or `blocker`.
- Gain an understanding of the needs for that issue, and ask questions in Discord for advice.
- Explicitly say that you'd like to take a shot at solving an issue and we'll mark you as assigned.
- If you later realize you aren't prepared to solve the issue, or something else unexpected comes up, that's totally fine - please communicate that, and we'll remove you from the assigned field.
- If you aren't able to current solve an issue, but would like to provide suggestions or advice, please participate on the Github issues. Collaboration is greatly appreciated.

## Getting Ramped Up / Fun
- The best way to understand how `esy` works is to just try it out, and fix the
  first thing to go wrong or the first missing feature you wish it had.
